# NL2SQL-LangGraph
This repository contains a proof of concept using AI agents to translate natural-language questions into SQL, execute the queries against a database, and generate a PDF report. The system is fully containerized: Dockerized backend and frontend, PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension, and pgAdmin for database management.
